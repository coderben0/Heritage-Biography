        "My ninety-nine year old mother chose the text version for her Heritage
        Biography, based on a skilled in-depth interview. She related many
        beloved family anecdotes. In addition, to my surprise and delight, she
        shared hitherto unknown childhood memories. It is a treasure which has
        become a cherished family heirloom. Heritage Biography International
        earns my recommendation for capturing precious details of family
        history."

      <p class="t_paragraph">I don’t know how to thank Elaine for doing this video—it’s the most wonderful memory that I have of my mom. My mom passed away a couple of years after Elaine did the Heritage Video, and I am so grateful to her---I love her for doing this for me, and everyone should do it!
Thank you, Elaine.
