      <h1>Faq</h1>
      <h3>What is a heritage biography?</h3>
      <p>
        It is your own personal life story, conducted in the form of an
        interview, which usually runs from one to three hours. The finished
        product is in the form of an efile/zip drive.
      </p>
      <h3>How will I know what to say?</h3>
      <p>
        You will be given an outline/questionnaire to fill out. Topics include
        your family history, education, job experiences, marriage, courtship,
        children, hobbies and much more. This information will serve as a
        chronological guide through your life events. Should you see a section
        on which you do not wish to be interviewed, you can omit it. You can
        also organize photographs to go along with the topics. They can be shown
        during the interview, or scanned at a later date.
      </p>
      <h3>Where will it take place?</h3>
      <p>
        The session is filmed in the comfort of your home, which gives you an
        ideal opportunity to “show and tell” about favorite souvenirs, art,
        awards, and hobbies. Many women like to relate and point out the details
        of family jewelry like engagement rings or family heirlooms, as well as
        military awards and decorations.
      </p>
      <h3>How much does a heritage biography cost?</h3>
      <p>
        A two to four hour session runs $3000 for an individual, $5000 for a
        couple. Payment can be made in full or in separate installments: $1500
        before the interview, and $1500 upon receipt of the finished product.
      </p>
      <h3>How is the quality of the finished product?</h3>
      <p>
        The finished product is media quality. The interview can be photographed
        in person by a professional videographer or in a recorded Zoom
        interview.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I look my best?</h3>
      <p>
        Ladies, schedule the session so that you will be fresh from a hair
        appointment. If you wish, we can arrange for the services of a
        professional makeup artist. Men should get a hair cut one week before
        the taping session. Wear your nicest clothes and jewelry just as you
        would for a special occasion.
      </p>
      <h3>Why a heritage biography?</h3>
      <p>
        The answer to this question is another question: How would you like to
        take a video off the shelf of your great great grandparents to see how
        they looked and spoke, to hear about their experiences from their own
        lips? With a heritage biography, you will be enabling your future (and
        present) descendants to have this very experience.
